# JAG-MdsNet
This is the implementation of the article: "**A Multi-Domain Dual-Stream Network for Hyperspectral Unmixing**".

  "**Results_samson.mat**',"**Results_jasper.mat**',"**Results_urban.mat**": The mats contain all the source unmixing results of the **MdsNet**.  
    >>>**A** denotes the unmixing results of abundance maps;  
    >>>**M1** denotes the unmixing results of endmembers;  
    >>>**Y_c** denotes the coarse domain pixel data we conducted in the experiments;  
    >>>**Y_d** denotes the differential pixels of the datasets, which can be expressed as Yc = Y - Y_d;  

The source code will be made available on this page soon. Thank you for your interest and stay tuned!
